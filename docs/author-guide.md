# Author guide

You do not need to know git. This place is a Desk: each book is a folder,
each chapter is a page, and GitHub keeps every version.

This walkthrough uses the GitHub website on a computer.

This repository is the **private Desk** in a
[Bookself](https://github.com/Svyable/bookself/blob/main/docs/bookself.md)
setup. The public shelf is [Svyable/shelf](https://github.com/Svyable/shelf).
This Svyable Desk also has an intentionally public working-draft Reader at
`https://svyable.github.io/desk/reader/`. That preview is public even though
the Git repository is private.

## In one minute

1. Copy `books/_TEMPLATE/` to `books/your-title/` (lowercase, hyphens).
2. Open a chapter, click the pencil, write, and **Commit changes**.
3. When the book is meant to be published, prepare a release with
   `scripts/release-book.sh your-title ../shelf`, review the Shelf diff, and
   commit the release there.

The rest of this guide is the same path, slower.

## 1. What this place is

The repository is a stack of books. Open [`books/`](../books/). The folder
named `_TEMPLATE` is a blank book you can copy, not a real title. Every other
folder is a book.

Inside a book:

- `README.md` — the cover and table of contents
- `manuscript/` — the pages
- `media/` — pictures, when a book has them

## 2. Reading a book

1. Open the book folder.
2. Open `README.md`. The **Contents** list is the reading order. Click a
   chapter name.
3. Read the page. GitHub turns Markdown into readable text automatically.

The file list inside `manuscript/` is alphabetical, so `back-matter.md` will
not sit at the end. Trust the README, not the file list.

For the Reader view, use the public working preview at
`https://svyable.github.io/desk/reader/`. A direct book route is
`reader/#/b/<slug>/`.

## 3. Making your first edit

1. Open the chapter you want to change.
2. Click the pencil icon in the top-right of the file view. GitHub labels
   it **Edit this file**.
3. The page becomes a text editor. Change the words. Leave the single `#`
   title at the top unless you are renaming the chapter.
4. Do not paste in Word formatting, extra headings, or comments.

If GitHub asks you to fork the repository, say yes — that is how GitHub lets
people without write access propose an edit.

## 4. Committing (saving a version)

Scroll to the bottom of the edit page, to **Commit changes**.

1. In the first box, write a short note in plain language:
   `Fix the river image caption in chapter 2`.
2. Choose how to save:
   - **Commit directly to the `main` branch** — use this only if you are a
     named author of this book (see the book's README).
   - **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** — use
     this otherwise. It is the "propose changes" path.
3. Click **Commit changes** (or **Propose changes**).

A commit is a saved version with a note. It is not publication. It is a dated
save point on the Desk.

## 5. Ticking checkboxes in the table of contents

The book's README has a contents list like this:

    - [ ] [Ch 1 — Opening the Desk](manuscript/ch01-example.md)

The boxes do not toggle by clicking them on the page. To mark a chapter
done:

1. Open the book `README.md`.
2. Click the pencil.
3. Change `[ ]` to `[x]` on that line.
4. Update the **Chapters** count in the info table if it has drifted.
5. Commit as in step 4.

## 6. Suggesting a change on someone else's line

Two similar tools, for two situations.

**You are reading a file and want to propose a better sentence.** Use the
pencil as in step 3, change only that passage, and open a pull request
(step 4, "propose changes"). In the PR description, say which lines you
touched and why.

**You are reviewing a pull request.** On the **Files changed** tab, hover a
line, click the blue **+**, and choose to add a comment. GitHub can insert a
suggested replacement the author accepts with one click. Prefer that over a
vague "please rephrase."

## 7. Filing feedback without editing

If you would rather not touch the text:

1. Open the **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New issue**.
3. Choose **Chapter feedback**.
4. Pick the book, say where in the book, pick the kind of feedback, and
   write what you would change.

Use **New book proposal** only when you are pitching a title that does not
exist yet.

## 8. Releasing to the public Shelf

Do not set Status to `Published` expecting this private Desk to become the
public Shelf. Commit the Desk version first, then run:

```bash
scripts/release-book.sh your-title ../shelf
```

The release helper verifies the Desk/Shelf roles, prepares the exact Shelf
snapshot, sets the Shelf copy to `Published`, updates the public catalog, and
stops before commit or push so you can review the public diff. The lower-level
`scripts/promote-book.sh` remains available for copy-only work, but it does not
publish or verify a release.
