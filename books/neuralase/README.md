*Transformer Loops and the Intelligence of the Second Pass*

A transformer can produce an answer in one forward pass, then produce another token by running again. A reasoning system can go further: it can feed a provisional answer back into itself, branch into competing attempts, call a tool, inspect the result, reuse the same layers at greater depth, or keep working in latent space before saying anything at all. **Neuralase** argues that these forms of re-entry are becoming a distinct scaling axis for artificial intelligence.

The book introduces **neuralase** as Sven Hardy Benson’s term for the mechanism that makes a reasoning loop productive: not repetition, but a return path plus a discriminating signal. A loop without new evidence, a verifier, an environmental consequence, a constraint, a competing path, or a learned stopping rule can merely amplify the first mistake. A useful loop changes what the next pass has available to notice.

The central claim is that the frontier of reasoning is moving from a simple question — *How large is the model?* — toward a second question: *What is allowed to happen between the first representation of a problem and the final answer?* Parameters still matter. Data still matter. Training still matters. But inference is becoming an active computational process whose depth, branching, tools, memory, verification, and stopping rules can be designed.

“Neuralase” is a coined conceptual term in this manuscript, not an established biological process, scientific field, model architecture, or claim of priority over the underlying research traditions cited in the research trail.

## Editorial principles

1. **Keep architecture levels distinct.** A standard Transformer layer stack, autoregressive token generation, explicit chain-of-thought, external agent loops, and recurrent-depth Transformers are related but not interchangeable.
2. **Do not romanticize repetition.** More passes can improve performance, waste compute, entrench an error, or make a model abandon a correct answer. The feedback channel matters.
3. **Treat “Neuralase” as a lens, not a scientific discovery claim.** The original contribution is the synthesis and vocabulary, not retroactive ownership of recurrence, verification, search, or test-time compute.
4. **Prefer primary research.** Use original papers, proceedings, and first-party research pages for technical claims; use contemporary reporting only when the reporting itself is the object of discussion.
5. **Preserve negative evidence.** Self-correction failures, chain-of-thought unfaithfulness, diminishing test-time returns, and overthinking are central to the thesis rather than inconvenient exceptions.
6. **Separate visible reasoning from actual computation.** A verbal rationale can help, but it is not guaranteed to be a faithful transcript of internal causal computation.
7. **Make stopping a first-class design problem.** A system that can continue thinking also needs a principled reason to stop.
